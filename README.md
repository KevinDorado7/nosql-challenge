## Background
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. I have been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

### Instructions
## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
- Import the provided data into MongoDB.
- Verify the data is properly loaded by listing databases and collections.
- Assign the collection to a variable for further use.

## Part 2: Update the Database
- Add a new restaurant to the database.
- Find and update the BusinessTypeID for the new restaurant.

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
- Answer specific questions to help determine the locations for future articles.
- Utilize queries to find establishments with certain hygiene scores and ratings.
- Convert results to Pandas DataFrames for better visualization.

## Part 4: Aggregation Pipeline
- Create an aggregation pipeline to determine the number of establishments with a hygiene score of 0 in each Local Authority area.
- Sort the results from highest to lowest and print the top ten local authority areas.

### Additional Information
To complete this activity, I have used resources such as Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT to debug and optimize the code's functionality. Additionally, I mostly used ChatGPT for the usage of the attribute .shape, which helped me to represent the number of rows in the data frames.
